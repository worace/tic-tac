;; Min-Maxing
;; 1 - need to calculate a "score" for given game states
;;   - score is from perspective of a given player (X/O)
;; 2 - at each turn, need to calculate score for
;;     each possible move
;;   - take the move that returns the highest score
;;
;; Depth:
;; - specify how many iterations to look in each dir?
